# HTR-and-Summariser-using-Pretrained-models-main
The repository is a valuable resource for performing Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and text summarization tasks using pre-trained models. This project aims to simplify the implementation of these tasks by providing code and resources that leverage state-of-the-art models, eliminating the need for extensive training.
